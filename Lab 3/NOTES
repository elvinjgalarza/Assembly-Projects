;TEST CASE

use another register for checking for null
because you will lose the address you're currently at!!

ADD R0, R0, #1 for array
LDR R0, R0, #0 gives us next node
LDR R0, R0, #1 to go to previous node

to get data LDR R1, R0, #2
	    LDR R2, R0, #3

to check for NULL
BRz L1

; Removing NODES
LDR R2, R1, #0
LDR R0, R1, #1
LDR R3, R1, #0
STR R3, R0, #0
